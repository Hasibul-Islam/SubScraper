# SubScraper

How it works?

Do you feel irritated downloading subtitle for movie? Your saviour is here! Just enter the movie name and boooom! Your english subtitle for the movie will be downloaded. Our Scraper searches for the best subtitle and downloads it automatically. Try to provide the movie name as close as possible. You know he's just a robot ;)
This is a django pet project. The system takes input of movie name in the search box and brings the best english subtitle for that movie and automatically downloads it.

How to Use:

<p>git clone https://github.com/Hasibul-Islam/SubScraper.git</p>

<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>

Go!
